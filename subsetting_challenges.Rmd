## Subsetting a named vector


Here is a named numeric vector:
```{r, results=''}
x <- c("a" = 5.4, "b" = 6.2, "c" = 7.1, "d" = 4.8, "e" = 7.5)
print(x)
```

Come up with **3 commands** which produce the following output:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x[c(2:4)]
```

## List subsetting

obtain the number `2`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
```


```{r}
xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", 
              b = 1:10,
              c = head(gapminder))
xlist
```
